This tutorial book is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to forecasting strategies of network data. The theoretical of the methods are not exhaustively discussed and further reading can be found in the references at the end of each chapter with more advanced or detailed treatment of the subject. We use R throughout the book, and we intend students to learn how to forecast with R. The concepts and tools are taught on the same frame, so you will learn the theory and the implementation at the same time. R is free and it is a broad-based application for statistical analysis in general, not just for forecasting. A good introduction to R language can be found in: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf.The R Studio online learning resources have tutorials and links on various aspects of the R language and R Studio environment: https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/. And finally, the book R for Data Science presents an excellent introduction of data analytics with R and can be found in https://bookdown.org Most quantitative prediction problems use either time series data (collected at regular intervals over time) or cross-sectional data (collected at a single point in time). In this book we are concerned with forecasting future data, and we concentrate on the time series domain. Anything that is observed sequentially over time is a time series. In this book, we will only consider time series that are observed at regular intervals of time (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually). Irregularly spaced time series can also occur, but are beyond the scope of this book. This book focusses on the short term forecasting of travel time data collected using automatic number plate recognition data as part of Transport for London’ s London Congestion Analysis Project.1 An online version of this book is available at http://XXXXX*.

Motivations Network science literature has gained popularity to a broad spectrum of areas such as engineering, economics and geography over the last decade. Most of the approaches focus on analysing characteristics and opportunities of enhancing the effectiveness of a network system. Many researches centre on questions regarding structural and dynamics issues, as well as their implications to the outcomes of a network system. This book aims to contribute to the literature of network and statistical forecasting. The document drives the students to the theories and, by means of practical sections, offers a comprehensive introduction to forecasting methods to network data. The principal objectives of the book can be presented as follow: The main objectives are Apply time series modelling to forecast travel times of network data of urban roads. Gain insights into spatio-temporal dataset and uncover patterns in spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal data. To evaluate the applied forecasting methodologies and discuss strengths and weaknesses of each model. Prerequisites To get the most out of this book, it is assumed that you are numerically literate and you also have some programming experience already. To run the code of this book, you need fisrt to install RStudio and have tidyverse packages installed. RStudio is an integrated development environment, or IDE, for R programming. You can download and install it from http://www.rstudio.com/download. Further instructions of how to set-up R can be accessed in the Appendix. Base packages are preinstalled and can be loaded using library('package_name'). Libraries from a repository called CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network, https://cran.r-project.org) need to be installed first using install.packages('package_name') before they can be loaded using library. Conventions Throughout the book we use a consistent set of conventions to refer to code: Functions are in a code font and followed by parentheses, like sum(), or mean(). Used for program listings to refer to program elements such as variable or function names, databases, data types, element variables, statements and keyword, are in a code font, without parentheses, like data or x. If we want to make it clear what package an object comes from, we’ll use the package name followed by two colons, like dplyr::mutate(). We also employ some specific typographical conventions: italic indicates new terms, reference sources, filenames and file extensions. bold indicates the name of R packages. Constant width italic shows text that should be replaced with use-supplied values or by values determined by context. For your convenience (e.g. when you want to copy and run the code), we do not add prompts (&gt; and +) to R source code in this book and outputs are preceded by ##. These are the results of running the code and should not be typed in the console or included in your scripts. You should see these outputs in your R Studio console when you run the code. Acknowledgements This book is the results of many people that we would like to address our thanks.
