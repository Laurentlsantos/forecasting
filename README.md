# Forecasting Network Data
###### Laurent L. Santos and Francisco S. Castillo
First published 2019

Welcome to Introduction to Spatial Network Forecast with R. This tutorial book is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to forecasting strategies of network data.

We use R throughout the book, and we intend students to learn how to forecast with R. The concepts and tools are taught on the same framework, so you will learn the theory and the implementation at the same time. R is free and it is a broad based application for statistical analysis in general, not just for forecasting.

A good introduction to R language can be found in: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf. The R Studio online learning resources have tutorials and links on various aspects of the R language and R Studio environment: https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/. And finally, the book R for Data Science presents an excellent introduction of data analytics with R and can be found in https://bookdown.org.

Most quantitative prediction problems use either time series data (collected at regular intervals over time) or cross-sectional data (collected at a single point in time). In this book we are concerned with forecasting future data, and we concentrate on the time series domain. Anything that is observed sequentially over time is a time series. In this book, we will only consider time series that are observed at regular intervals of time (for example, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually). Irregularly spaced time series can also occur, but are beyond the scope of this book.

A number of practical decisions problems in business fall into a category known as network flow problems. These problems share a common characteristics: they can be described in a graphical form knows as a network. This book focusses on the short term forecasting1 of transportation network flow problem. Travel time data collected using automatic number plate recognition data as part of Transport for London Congestion Analysis Project2 are applied throughout the book.

More advanced or detailed treatment of the methods can be found in the reference section of each chapter. Comments, feedbacks or any additional information, please send an email to ucesljl@ucl.ac.uk.
