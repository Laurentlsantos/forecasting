<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Network: fundamentals</h3>
<p>The network science literature provides a diverse range of tools and techniques for analysing and enhancing our understanding of the structure and large-scale statistical properties of networks. A network is a set of discrete items, called nodes, with connections between them, called edges. A network is typically represented as a graph G = (N, E), with a set of N nodes and E edges. In road network, Each intersection is a node and the road segments between intersections are edges.</p>
<p>A <em>bimodal network</em> (also called bipartite network) is one which connects two varieties of things, whereas <em>unimodal</em> (or unimode) network connects nodes with same characteristics.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>To analyse and model a network process, a network can be represented mathematically by an matrix describing the list of adjacency edges of incoming and outgoing vectors (Figure <a href="getting-started.html#fig:chunk-matrix">1.2</a>).</p>

</div>
<p>In broad terms, networks can be divides into four categories <em><span class="citation">(see M.E.J.Newman <a href="#ref-R-newman">2003</a>)</span></em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Social Network</em>: a set of people (or animals) or groups of people with associations between them. The core foundation of social network analysis is to understand the effect of social networks on social processes (e.g., friendship networks, academic collaborations, business relationships, animal behavior).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Information Network</em>: Networks of information flow. Pieces of information are stored at the nodes. The edges between nodes signify connections between information sources. (e.g., academic citation networks, world wide web).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Biological Network</em>: Networks of biological systems, where the nodes are biological entities, and the edges are connections between them (e.g., metabolic networks, neural networks, food webs).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Technological Network</em>: Man-made, physical networks, designed to transport people, resources or commodities. (e.g., transportation networks of roads, rail and airlines).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The scales of analysis of a network is usually decomposed in three different levels of description. Network theory has long been applied to transportation systems studies which seek to understand the dynamics of physical networks designed to transport people in order to evaluate impacts on transportation system performance <em><span class="citation">(see F. Xie <a href="#ref-R-xie">2007</a>)</span></em>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Road network and travel time as a variable for transportation</h3>
<p><em>Road network</em> is among the most recognisable and studied types of network. Traffic on urban networks is fundamentally different to traffic on highways, primarily because it is interrupted by traffic signals at intersections.</p>
<p>The underlying factor that determines the speed of the traffic stream on both highways and urban roads is interaction between the demand for road space and the supply of road space, known as “capacity”. Congestion is characterised by slow moving stop and go traffic and is very frustrating and costly for road users.</p>
<p><em>Travel time</em> is one of the most important variables in transportation. Accurate travel-time prediction is crucial to the development of transportation systems and advanced traveler information systems . Travel time prediction in conjunction with traffic network analytics fosters route-guidance systems and supports transportation planning and operations. Some of the common applications are listed on table table 1.</p>

<p>The study of road network structure predates the field of complex networks and has long been of interest due to its inherent impact on transportation system performance. The factor that determines the speed of the traffic stream on both highways and urban roads is interaction between the demand for road space and the supply of road space known as capacity. Congestion is characterised by slow moving stop and go traffic.</p>
<p>Forecasting models of network data have traditionally focussed on time series approaches. In such approaches, the network structure is ignored and each of the time series at the nodes is forecast independently. More recent approaches use network structures to construct spatio-temporal models that capture the spatio-temporal dependency between locations where network data are observed.</p>
<p>Increasingly, researchers and practitioners are turning towards less conventional techniques, often with their roots in the machine learning (ML) and data mining communities, that are better equipped to deal with the heterogeneous, nonlinear and multi-scale properties of large scale network datasets.</p>
<p>For the forecast of urban network, observations are made at regular intervals using traffic static sensors, such as loop detectors or automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, which measure traffic conditions at a fixed point, or along a section of road called a link. These sensors are distributed across the network, and when considered together form a space time series that describes the network process (e.g. transportation systems, the internet and electrical grids).</p>
<p>The majority of the literature on traffic forecasting focuses on data-driven approaches. In such approaches, statistical relationships are extracted from historical data, and used to forecast future traffic conditions using information about the current traffic conditions.</p>
<p>Spatial network data combines the challenges of modelling time series and spatial series, which are autocorrelation, nonstationarity, heterogeneity and nonlinearity <span class="citation">(see Haworth <a href="#ref-R-haworth2013">2013</a>)</span>. The choice of method depends on the dataset and an explanatory spatio-temporal data analysis must be done to better understand the characteristics of the data.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Space-time Series Forecasting</h3>
<p>A time series is a set of observations on quantitative variables collected over time. In conjunction with a spatial component, the series turns out to be a <em>space-time series</em> of values for a quantitative variable over time. Most businesses keep track of a number of time series and geographic information science also rely on data series to forecast environmental risk, weather forecast, land-cover changes over time and rout network forecast.</p>
<p>There are many forms to predict the behaviour of a dependent variable using one or more independent variables that are believed to be related to the dependent variable in a causal fashion. Although we can sometimes use regression models to predictive analysis, its is not always possible to do so. For example, if we do not know which causal independent variables are influencing a particular time series variable, we cannot build a regression model. And even if we do have some idea which causal variables are affecting a time series, there might not be any data available for those variables. Moreover, even if the estimated regression function fits the data well, we might have to forecast the values of the causal independent variables in order to estimate future values of the dependent (time series) variable.</p>
<p>That said, it might be difficult or even undesirable to forecast time series data using a regression model. In these cases, it is advisable to use a time series forecasting method in which we analyse the past behaviour of the time series variables in order to predict its future behaviour. The predictability of an event depends on several factors <em><span class="citation">(see Hyndman and Athanasopoulos <a href="#ref-R-Hyndman">2018</a>)</span></em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>How well we understand the factors that contribute to it;</li>
<li>How much data is available;</li>
<li>Whether the forecast can somehow affect the process that is being forecast.</li>
</ul>
<p>Techniques that analyse the past behaviour of a time series variable to predict the future are sometimes referred to as <em>extrapolation model</em>. The general form of an extrapolation model is:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Images/f_forecast.png" alt="Equation 1.1" />
<p class="caption">Equation 1.1</p>
</div>
<p>where Y<sub>t=1</sub> represents the predicted value for the time series variable in time period <em>t+1</em>, Y<sub>t</sub> represents the value of the time series variable in time period <em>t</em>, and so on. The goal of an extrapolation model is to identify a function <em>f()</em> for the equation 1.1 that produces accurate forecasts of future values of the time series variable.</p>
<p>Many methods have been developed to model time series data. A common approach involves trying several modeling techniques on a given data set and evaluating how well they explain the past behavior of the time series variable. The most used accuracy measures are the <em>mean absolute deviation</em> (MAD), the <em>mean absolute percent error</em> (MAPE), the <em>mean square error</em> (MSE), ant the <em>root mean square error</em> (RMSE).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Forecasting Models of Spatial Network Data</h3>
<p>Forecasting models of network data have traditionally focussed on time and flow series approaches. In such approaches, the network structure is ignored and each of the time series at the nodes is forecast independently.</p>
<p>Because of the many factors that determine urban traffic, it is very difficult to model traffic as a physical process. Therefore, the majority of the literature on traffic forecasting focuses on data-driven approaches. In such approaches, statistical relationships are extracted from historical data, and used to forecast future traffic conditions.</p>
<p>Observations of a space-time process are made at the nodes of a spatial network, which are sampling locations such as weather stations or traffic flow detectors. At each node an individual time series is collected that describes the temporal evolution of the space-time process at a single point in space.</p>
<p>A time series <em>z = {z(t)|z є T}</em> in temporal domain T is a sequence of observations of a process taken at equally spaced time intervals: <em>z<sub>T</sub>, z<sub>t-1</sub>,… z<sub>t-(n-1)</sub></em>, where <em>z<sub>t</sub></em> denotes the value of some quantity z at time t and n is the lengh of the serie.</p>

<p>LCAP is a system of automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, maintained by TfL, that monitors London’s road network 24 hours a day. Link travel times of individual vehicles are recorded and aggregated at the 5 minute level, providing travel time information on all of London’s major roads. Figure 1.3 displays the main features of the monitor system.</p>

<p>The road networks of major cities are equipped with sensor networks that measure traffic properties directly from traffic stream. Traffic sensors can be either static or dynamic.</p>
<p>The data used in the turotial part of this book were collected using automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) technology on London’s road. Each road link is paired with two ANPR cameras installed on the start and the end of the link. The first camera records the vehicle license plate and entrance time and the second camera records the exit time by matching the license plate. For this study individual TTs were aggregated at 5 minutes intervals giving 180 observations per day between 6am and 9pm. The travel time data is presented in unit travel times (second/metre).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.2</span> Applied Methodologies</h3>
<p>Quantitative forecasting can be applied when two conditions are satisfied:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>numerical information about the past is available;</li>
<li>it is reasonable to assume that some aspects of the past patterns will continue into the future.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a wide range of quantitative forecasting methods, often developed within specific disciplines for specific purposes. Each method has its own properties, accuracies, and costs that must be considered when choosing a specific method.</p>
<p>When forecasting time series data, the aim is to estimate how the sequence of observations will continue into the future. To evaluate forecast accuracy it is common practice to separate the available data into two portions, <em>training</em> and <em>test data</em>. The training data is applied to estimate the parameters of the method and the test data is used to evaluate its accuracy.</p>

<p>The literature on space-time forecasting can be broadly separated into two categories of model. The statistical <em>parametric model</em> is usually based on some form of autoregression (AR), whereby the current value of a series is modelled as a function of its previous values. The space-time autoregressive integrated moving average (<em>STARIMA</em>) model is a widelly used parametric modelling framework for spatio-temporal data.</p>
<p>A parametric model is one where the functional form of the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is described by a set of parameter and for stationary time series in which there is no significant trend in the data over time. However, it is not unusual for time series data to exhibit some type of upward or downward trend over time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Trend</em> is the sweep or general direction of movement in a time series. It reflects the net influence of long-term factors that affect the time series in a consistent and gradual way over time. Many time series variables exhibit <em>seasonality</em>, or a regular, repeating pattern in the data. For example, urban traffic usually shows the same patterns on working days: heavy traffic are expected in the morning and after working hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As more real world datasets become available at higher spatial and temporal resolutions, the task of describing space-time structures with conventional methods becomes more difficult. Non-parametrics methods as <em>Machine Learning</em> provides an alternative approach. ML models tend to be more complex black–box models that are created to maximize predictive accuracy. They are used to model complex, nonlinear, non-stationary relationships in massive, real world datasets.</p>
<p>Machine learning uses past data to make accurate predictions of future events. Learning refers to the iterative process of finding a classifier or regression algorithm with optimal solution by means of training data, and then to test simulation data under the same parameters.</p>
<p>The focus of ML is on generalisation, the ability of the algorithm to predict unseen data samples. It stands as a different approach of classical statistics, where the focus is on in-sample performance and different to data mining which seeks to discover new knowledge from unlabelled data. ML does not assume that the functional form of the relationship between dependent and independent variables is known and can be described by model parameter.The technique minimizes error on unseen data, known as structural risk minimization, with no prior assumptions made on the probability distribution of the data.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Supervised Learning</strong></em>: Given a set of labelled training data, a function is sought to predict labels for unseen data.
<ul>
<li>Examples: Regression (e.g. kernel ridge regression, SVR, ANNs); classification (e.g. SVMs, random forests, ANNs).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em><strong>Semi-supervised learning</strong></em>: Small amount of labelled data, large amount of unlabelled data. Using both can improve predictions.
<ul>
<li>Examples: Generative models, low density separation, graphical methods.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em><strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong></em>: No labels are supplied with training data, and structure is sought.
<ul>
<li>Examples: clustering (e.g. k-means, hierarchical), dimensionality reduction (e.g. PCA), self-organizing maps, density estimation, data mining techniques.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong></em>: A computer must perform a task in a given environment without knowledge of whether it has come close to its goal.
<ul>
<li>Examples: driverless cars, playing chess/Go against an opponent, DeepMind.</li>
